The project consists of three core components:
* yaw_pitch: Determines whether the student is looking at the monitor.
* eye_status: Detects whether the student's eyes are open or closed.
* face_recognition: Compares the detected face with a reference image to verify the studentâ€™s identity.

Additionally, there are three testing components:
* looking_result: Integrates all three core functions and returns a result code.
* test files: Each core directory contains a test.py file to help you test specific functions.
* Graphical_output: Displays the entire image along with the processed output, useful for visual testing.

## Result Codes
The system generates result codes ranging from 0 to 5 to provide more detailed feedback. You can find their meanings in the result_codes.csv file.
